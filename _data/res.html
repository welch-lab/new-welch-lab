- title: "Functional coordination of non-myocytes plays a key role in adult zebrafish heart regeneration"

  description: Using the LIGER algorithm, we assemble an atlas of cell states from 61,977 individual non-CM scRNA-seq profiles isolated at multiple time points during regeneration. This analysis reveals extensive non-CM cell diversity, including multiple macrophage (MC), fibroblast (FB), and endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations with unique spatiotemporal distributions, and suggests an important role for MC in inducing the activated FB and EC subpopulations. Furthermore, we developed computational algorithm Topologizer to map the topological relationships and dynamic transitions between functional states. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of non-CMs during cardiac regeneration provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of this process.
