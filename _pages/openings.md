# Open positions

Postdoctoral Researcher

Laboratory of Joshua Welch

Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics

Department of Computer Science and Engineering

University of Michigan

Ann Arbor, MI

**Job Summary and Responsibilities:**

The Welch Laboratory at the University of Michigan is seeking a postdoctoral researcher to
develop and apply algorithms, machine learning methods, and statistical models for analysis of
single-cell genomic data. Our research focuses on enabling biological discovery by applying
novel computational approaches to genomic data. Broadly, we seek to understand what genes
define the complement of cell types and cell states within healthy tissue, how cells differentiate
to their final fates, and how dysregulation of genes within specific cell types contributes to
human disease. This postdoctoral position will focus on methods for analyzing and integrating
single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell epigenome data, and spatial transcriptomic data as part of two
NIH-funded projects. We have data and biological collaborators from several different systems,
including mouse bone marrow, mouse brain, and human hematopoietic stem cells. This is such
an exciting and fast-moving field that Nature Methods recently selected “Single-Cell Multimodal
Omics Analysis” as the Method of the Year 2019.

A unique benefit of this position is the rich set of collaborative opportunities available, allowing
truly interdisciplinary training. Our collaborative network includes bench scientists and
computational method development colleagues within the Michigan Center for Single-Cell
Genomic Data Analytics, and more broadly within the Michigan Institute for Data Science
(MIDAS). The Center hosts weekly meetings in which faculty and trainees discuss ongoing work
and form new collaborations. Additional opportunities for collaboration are available with
faculty in the Computer Science and Engineering department and the School of Medicine.
Desired Qualifications:
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in computational biology, bioinformatics, computer science,
statistics, mathematics, or related field, and familiarity with high-throughput sequencing data.
Life scientists with significant computational expertise should also apply. Additional desirable
qualities include the ability to effectively work both independently and in a team, good
communication skills, and a love for both computational method development and biological
discovery.

Interested applicants should submit a brief statement of interest, CV, and contact information
for three references.
