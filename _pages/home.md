Most recently, I have focused on developing open-source software for the processing, analysis, and modeling of single-cell sequencing data. Key contributions in this area include SLICER, an algorithm for inferring developmental trajectories; LIGER, a general approach for integrating single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data; and online iNMF, a scalable and iterative algorithm for single-cell data integration. I have applied these methods in collaboration with biological scientists to study stem cell differentiation, somatic cell reprogramming, and the brain.
