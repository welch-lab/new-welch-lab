Most recently, I have focused on developing open-source software for the processing, analysis, and modeling of single-cell sequencing data. Key contributions in this area include LIGER, a general approach for integrating single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data; online iNMF, a scalable and iterative algorithm for single-cell data integration; and MultiVelo, a tool for modeling cell fate transitions from single-cell multi-omic data. I have applied these methods in collaboration with biological scientists to study stem cell differentiation, somatic cell reprogramming, and the mammalian brain.
