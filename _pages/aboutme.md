Personal:
When I'm not working, I spend a lot of time with my wife and kids. I enjoy running, biking, and swimming outdoors.
I love playing classical piano&mdash;you can hear some of my recordings on my [SoundCloud channel](https://on.soundcloud.com/ppr1C). I also play piano and guitar at my [church](https://www.redeemera2.org/). I recently helped to launch the [Michigan Christian Study Center](https://bit.ly/mcsc-alumnimagazine) and serve on its board of directors.
